## About this app:

This application allows a user to check the current weather, and notifies a user about the weather information by LINENotify at a specific time everyday if it's configured.

To be able to receive notification, you have to register/login to this app.

You can see weather information in browser by inputting zipcode without registration or login.

üåè Currently, this application supports four countries (USA, Germany, Thailand, Singapore)
 to fetch weather information.

## Why I created this app

This app was mainly created to show my skill in both web and mobile development. I've used some languages such as React.js and Nativescript, therefore showing the level of skill I have with these languages.

Both React.js and Node.js are skills used to develop both frontend and backend development.  In the node.js side, I created some entrypoints to handle some functions such as connecting with LINENotify.

I also have some experience with using Cloud platform, threfore I integrated firebase for authentication and AWS for managing production server.


## What technology I used

* React.js (Frontend) <br>
  - React router
  - Redux
* SCSS (UI designning)
* Semantic UI React (UI designning)
* Node.js (Backend)
* PM2 (To demonize a process)
* Firebase (Authentication)
* AWS EC2 (As Production Server)
  - Route53
  - Elastic IP
  - Loadbalancer
  * VPC is default VPC
